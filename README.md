# OpenCV Face Detection

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier.

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV if you haven't already
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python

##Usage
1. Run the face_detection.py script:
  ```bash
  python face_detection.py
2.Press 'q' to exit the program.

##Acknowledgements

The face detection algorithm uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier, which is based on the work of Viola and Jones.
